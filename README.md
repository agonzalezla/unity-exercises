# PROGRAMMING EXERCISES IN “C#” TO LEARN “UNITY”.

This repository contains multilevel exercises to learn the “UNITY” game development engine. The exercises are separated into three levels: Basic, Intermediate and Advanced.

## Tools to perform the exercises

* You will need to have the “UNITY” game development engine installed. (https://unity.com/)

* You will need to have an “IDE” to be able to work with the “C#” code which is the programming language of “UNITY”. The IDE that integrates best with UNITY is "Visual Studio". (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

* It is also advisable to use a version management tool for your projects. You can use “Git” (https://git-scm.com/) or use the tool provided by “UNITY” “Unity Version Control” (https://unity.com/es/how-to/redeem/version-control).


## How to perform the exercises

All exercises have a file “statementOfExercise.txt” containing the statement of the problem to be solved. To solve it you have to create a new project in unity and do the following instructions. If you have doubts or you don't know how to solve it, you can import the code with the solved problem in the “codeExercise” folder inside each exercise.
